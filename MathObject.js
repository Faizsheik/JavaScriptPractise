/*
NULL: (both literal and primitive value)
null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Itâ€™s explicitly set by the developer to indicate that a variable is empty or does not hold any value.

NAN:  (not a literal)
NaN stands for Not-a-Number. 
It indicates that a value is not a valid number but is being used in a numeric operation.

undefined: (both literal and primitive value)
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

NOTE: Primitive values are actual types of primitive data types.
